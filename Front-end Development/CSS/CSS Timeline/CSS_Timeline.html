                    Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they 
                    were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares 
                    and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial 
                    public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is 
                    Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was 
                    appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai 
                    also became the CEO of Alphabet.
